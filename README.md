# Balanced-Evolutionary-Semi-Stacking

* Code for the paper ''BESS: Balanced Evolutionary Semi-Stacking for Disease Detection via Partially Labeled Imbalanced Tongue Data'' by Zhihan Ning et al.

* Required Python 3 packages: 
    1. sklearn (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
    2. imblearn (https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn)
    3. lightgbm (https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM)

* Testing: `python3 main.py`

* BESS is compatible with most sklearn APIs but is not strictly tested.
